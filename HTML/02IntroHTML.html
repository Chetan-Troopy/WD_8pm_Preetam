<!-- UTF-8 is a character encoding standard used to represent Unicode characters as a sequence 
of 1 to 4 bytes. It's the most common encoding used on the web and is backward-compatible 
with ASCII, meaning it can represent the first 128 characters of ASCII with a single byte.
 This makes it ideal for handling a wide range of characters, including those from languages 
 other than English -->
